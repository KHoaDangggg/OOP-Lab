- Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
- Answer: No, because category and title have same type String, so JAVA can not distinguish between 2 constructors so we got error.


- Question: When should we use accessor methods?
- Answer: accessor methods are commonly used in Java in thse case:
+ Encapsulation: accessor methods help users to ensure all access to the attributes being safe and controlled.
+ Data Validation: validate the input data before setting it to the private attributes of a class. For example, we can validate money user withdraw and accept if the withdraw money is less than or equal to total money user have.
+ Abstraction: provide a layer of abstraction between the internal representation of a class and the external. By providing a public interface with getters and setters, you can hide the implementation details of the class and provide a simplified interface for the users of the class.
+ Thread-Safety: ensure thread-safety in a multi-threaded environment, prevent multiple threads from accessing or modifying the attribute at the same time.
